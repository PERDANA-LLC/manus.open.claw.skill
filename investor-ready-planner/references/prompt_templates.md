1. Claude Cowork can analyze your market like a McKinsey researcher.

"Research the {{INDUSTRY}} market. Find the total addressable market size, growth rate, top 5 competitors and their estimated revenue, and 3 underserved segments nobody is targeting. Output everything in a table. No fluff. Just data I can put in front of investors."

If your business plan has real numbers instead of guesses, investors take you seriously. Period.

2. Claude Cowork can tear apart your business model and find the holes.

"Here's my business idea: {{PASTE_IDEA}}. Act like a brutal VC partner. Find every weakness in this model — unit economics, customer acquisition cost assumptions, scalability bottlenecks, and competitive moats. List every hole and rate each one: FATAL, SERIOUS, or MINOR. No sugarcoating. Be ruthless."

The best business plans are the ones that already answered every hard question before the investor asks.

3. Claude Cowork can build your entire financial projection from scratch.

"Build a 3-year financial projection for a {{BUSINESS_TYPE}} business. Starting revenue: {{AMOUNT}}. Monthly growth rate: {{X%}}. Include: revenue, COGS, gross margin, operating expenses, net profit, and cash runway. Output as a clean spreadsheet-ready table with monthly breakdown for Year 1 and quarterly for Years 2-3. Show me exactly when I break even."

This is the slide that makes or breaks your pitch. Get it right.

4. Claude Cowork can write your executive summary better than a $500/hour consultant.

"Here's everything about my business: {{PASTE_DETAILS}}. Write a 1-page executive summary that covers: the problem, the solution, target market, business model, traction so far, competitive advantage, and the ask. Write it like a YC application — tight, specific, no buzzwords. Every sentence must earn its place. If a sentence doesn't make an investor lean forward, delete it."

Your executive summary has 30 seconds to hook an investor. Make every word count.

5. Claude Cowork can reverse-engineer your competitor's entire business strategy.

"Research these 5 competitors in my space: {{LIST_COMPETITORS}}. For each one, find: their pricing model, target customer, main acquisition channels, key partnerships, estimated team size, and biggest weakness. Then tell me exactly how to position my business to win customers they're ignoring. Output as a competitive matrix table + a 5-point differentiation strategy."

The fastest way to build a winning business plan is to study everyone who came before you.

6. Claude Cowork can generate your entire pitch deck outline with investor-ready talking points.

"Create a 12-slide pitch deck outline for my business: {{PASTE_DETAILS}}. Follow this structure: Problem, Solution, Market Size, Product, Business Model, Traction, Team, Competition, Financials, Go-to-Market, Timeline, The Ask. For each slide, write the exact headline AND 3 bullet points with specific data points or claims I need to fill in. Flag anything where I need real numbers vs where you can estimate."

Investors don't fund ideas. They fund structured thinking. This is the structure.

7. Claude Cowork can stress-test your go-to-market strategy before you waste a dollar.

"Here's my go-to-market plan: {{PASTE_GTM_PLAN}}. Stress-test it. For each channel I listed, estimate: realistic CAC, time to first 100 customers, scalability ceiling, and dependency risks. Then rank my channels from highest ROI to lowest. If any channel is a waste of money for my stage, say so directly. Finally, suggest 2 channels I'm not considering that work for {{BUSINESS_TYPE}} businesses under $1M revenue."

Most startups die because they pick the wrong channels first. Don't be most startups.
