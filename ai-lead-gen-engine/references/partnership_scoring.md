# Partnership Scoring & Deal Structures

## Partnership Scoring Matrix

Rate each potential partnership on these dimensions (1-5 scale):

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Audience Fit | 30% | How closely the partner's audience matches your ICP |
| Reach | 20% | Size of the partner's audience |
| Engagement | 20% | How actively the audience engages with content |
| Accessibility | 15% | How easy it is to initiate a partnership |
| Cost Efficiency | 15% | Expected CPL relative to other channels |

**Score = (Fit × 0.3) + (Reach × 0.2) + (Engagement × 0.2) + (Access × 0.15) + (Cost × 0.15)**

Tier classification:
- **Tier 1 (Score 4.0+):** Start immediately, allocate 50% of budget
- **Tier 2 (Score 3.0-3.9):** Start within 30 days, allocate 30% of budget
- **Tier 3 (Score 2.0-2.9):** Test in quarter 2, allocate 20% of budget

## Negotiation Benchmarks

- Always start with a test run (1-2 placements) before committing to a package
- Ask for performance data from previous sponsors
- Negotiate based on CPA (cost per acquisition) not just CPM
- Request exclusivity in your category for premium placements
- Bundle multiple placements for volume discounts (typically 15-25% off)

## Red Flags

- No audience demographics data available
- Unwillingness to share past sponsor performance
- Engagement rates below 1% (newsletters) or 0.5% (social)
- Bot-heavy follower profiles
- No clear content calendar or publishing consistency
