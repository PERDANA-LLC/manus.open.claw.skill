## Template 1: The "10 Free Leads" Offer

**Subject:** Quick question, {{firstName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

My name is [Your Name] and I'm with [Your Agency]. I'm reaching out because I noticed you're the [Title] at {{companyName}}.

We specialize in helping [Their Industry] companies like yours get a consistent stream of qualified leads without paying for ads or expensive retainers.

To prove it, I'd like to offer you 10 highly-qualified, exclusive leads for free. No strings attached.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat next week to discuss?

Best,

[Your Name]

## Template 2: The Pain-Point Follow-Up

**Subject:** Re: Quick question

Hi {{firstName}},

Just following up on my previous email. Most [Title]s I speak with are struggling with either:

a) Unpredictable lead flow
b) High cost-per-lead from paid channels
c) Wasting time on unqualified prospects

We solve all three. Our pay-per-result model means you only pay for qualified leads we deliver.

Again, happy to send over 10 free leads to show you the quality of our work. Any interest?

Best,

[Your Name]

## Template 3: The Breakup Email

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back, so I'll assume now isn't the right time.

If you ever find yourself looking for a more predictable and cost-effective way to generate qualified leads, please feel free to reach out.

All the best for {{companyName}}.

Best,

[Your Name]
