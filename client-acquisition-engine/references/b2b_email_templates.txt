TEMPLATE 1: THE FREE AUDIT OPENER (Day 0 - Primary)
===============================================================================

Subject: {{city}} {{industry}} marketing

Hi {{firstName}},

I took a quick look at {{companyName}}'s online presence and spotted a few
things that are probably costing you leads right now.

For example, {{painPoint}}.

We work exclusively with {{industry}} businesses in markets like {{city}},
and I put together a free 5-minute audit showing exactly where you're
leaving money on the table.

No pitch, no strings. Just a PDF with specific fixes you can hand to
whoever manages your marketing.

Want me to send it over?

TEMPLATE 2: THE PAIN-POINT FOLLOW-UP (Day 3)
===============================================================================

Subject: re: {{city}} {{industry}} marketing

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick follow-up. Most {{industry}} owners I talk to in {{city}} are
dealing with at least one of these:

  1. Google Ads spending that feels like a black hole
  2. A website that looks fine but doesn't convert visitors into calls
  3. Competitors showing up above them in Google Maps

If any of those hit close to home, that free audit I mentioned would
be worth 5 minutes of your time.

{{proofPoint}}

Happy to send it over if you reply with "send it."

TEMPLATE 3: THE SOCIAL PROOF ANGLE (Day 5 - Alternative to Template 2)
===============================================================================

Subject: how {{proofPoint}}

Hi {{firstName}},

Wanted to share something relevant.

{{proofPoint}}

They were in a similar spot to {{companyName}} - solid service, good
reputation, but their online presence wasn't pulling its weight.

We made three specific changes to their digital marketing setup. The
results showed up within 60 days.

I can walk you through exactly what we did in a 10-minute call. No
obligation, and you'll walk away with at least one idea you can
implement yourself.

Worth a quick conversation?

TEMPLATE 4: THE COMPETITOR GAP (Day 0 - Alternative Opener)
===============================================================================

Subject: {{companyName}} vs competitors

Hi {{firstName}},

I was researching {{industry}} companies in {{city}} and noticed
something interesting about {{companyName}}.

Your competitors are investing heavily in their online presence -
Google Ads, SEO, review management - and it's showing up in the
search results. Right now, they're capturing leads that should be
going to you.

The good news: the gap isn't that wide. A few targeted changes could
shift the balance.

I put together a quick competitive analysis showing where
{{companyName}} stands versus the top 3 competitors in your area.
It's already done - just need your OK to send it.

Interested?

TEMPLATE 5: THE ROI CALCULATOR (Day 0 - Alternative Opener)
===============================================================================

Subject: quick math for {{companyName}}

Hi {{firstName}},

I ran some rough numbers for {{industry}} businesses in {{city}}:

  - Average cost per lead from Google Ads: $35-$85
  - Average close rate for qualified leads: 15-25%
  - Average job value for {{industry}}: $500-$2,500

That means every 10 qualified leads could be worth $750-$6,250 in
revenue.

Most {{industry}} businesses I work with are getting fewer than 10
qualified leads per month from their website and ads combined.
We typically double that number within 90 days.

Would it be useful to see what those numbers look like specifically
for {{companyName}}?

TEMPLATE 6: THE BREAKUP EMAIL (Day 7)
===============================================================================

Subject: closing the loop

Hi {{firstName}},

I've reached out a couple of times about helping {{companyName}}
generate more leads online, and I haven't heard back.

Totally fine - I know you're busy running a business, not reading
cold emails.

I'll leave you with this: if you ever want a no-cost audit of your
digital marketing (website, Google Ads, SEO, reviews), the offer
stands. Just reply to this email whenever the timing is right.

Wishing {{companyName}} a strong year ahead.

PERSONALIZATION GUIDELINES
===============================================================================

1. ALWAYS replace {{painPoint}} with something specific to the lead.
   Good: "Your Google Business Profile hasn't been updated since 2024"
   Bad:  "You might be missing out on leads"

2. ALWAYS replace {{proofPoint}} with a real or realistic case study.
   Good: "A plumber in Austin went from 8 to 34 monthly leads in 90 days"
   Bad:  "We help businesses grow"

3. Subject lines should be lowercase, 2-5 words, no punctuation tricks.

4. Keep total email length under 125 words for initial outreach.

5. Never use: "I hope this finds you well," "touching base," "synergy,"
   "leverage," "best-in-class," or "leading provider."

6. The CTA should require a one-word or one-line reply.
   Good: "Want me to send it over?"
   Good: "Worth a quick conversation?"
   Bad:  "Let me know when you're free for a 30-minute strategy session"
