- Controlling specific Hue rooms or zones
- Adjusting brightness, color, or color temperature

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**

- Non-Hue smart devices (other brands) → not supported
- HomeKit scenes or Shortcuts → use Apple's ecosystem
- TV or entertainment system control
- Thermostat or HVAC
- Smart plugs (unless Hue smart plugs)

## Installation

The `openhue` CLI is not pre-installed. To use this skill, you must first install it by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y golang-go
go install github.com/openhue/openhue-cli/cmd/openhue@latest
```

## Common Commands

### List Resources

```bash
openhue get light       # List all lights
openhue get room        # List all rooms
openhue get scene       # List all scenes
```

### Control Lights

```bash
# Turn on/off
openhue set light "Bedroom Lamp" --on
openhue set light "Bedroom Lamp" --off

# Brightness (0-100)
openhue set light "Bedroom Lamp" --on --brightness 50

# Color temperature (warm to cool: 153-500 mirek)
openhue set light "Bedroom Lamp" --on --temperature 300

# Color (by name or hex)
openhue set light "Bedroom Lamp" --on --color red
openhue set light "Bedroom Lamp" --on --rgb "#FF5500"
```

### Control Rooms

```bash
# Turn off entire room
openhue set room "Bedroom" --off

# Set room brightness
openhue set room "Bedroom" --on --brightness 30
```

### Scenes

```bash
# Activate scene
openhue set scene "Relax" --room "Bedroom"
openhue set scene "Concentrate" --room "Office"
```

## Quick Presets

```bash
# Bedtime (dim warm)
openhue set room "Bedroom" --on --brightness 20 --temperature 450

# Work mode (bright cool)
openhue set room "Office" --on --brightness 100 --temperature 250

# Movie mode (dim)
openhue set room "Living Room" --on --brightness 10
```

## Notes

- The Hue Bridge must be on the same local network.
- The first time you run `openhue`, you will need to press the button on the Hue Bridge to pair.
- Colors only work on color-capable bulbs (not white-only).
