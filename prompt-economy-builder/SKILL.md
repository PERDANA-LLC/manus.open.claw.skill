3.  **Sales Page Copywriter**: Write high-converting Gumroad sales pages.
4.  **Traffic & Distribution Strategist**: Drive organic traffic to your sales page.
5.  **Pricing & Packaging Optimizer**: Optimize pricing tiers for maximum revenue.
6.  **Customer Success System**: Achieve 4.9/5 ratings and 90%+ satisfaction.
7.  **Product Line Expander**: Scale from one product to a full ecosystem.
8.  **Automation & Scale System**: Automate the business to run on 4 hours/week.
9.  **Competitive Moat Builder**: Build a defensible business that can't be easily copied.

## Execution Workflow

For any given prompt business task, you MUST follow this four-step execution process:

1.  **Identify the Core Function**: Determine which of the 9 core functions the user is requesting.
2.  **Gather Inputs**: Collect the necessary inputs from the user (e.g., niche, product details, pricing ideas).
3.  **Apply the Prompt Template**: Use the corresponding prompt template from the `references` directory to structure your analysis and output.
4.  **Deliver Actionable Output**: Provide the final output in the specified format (e.g., market analysis table, sales page copy, 30-day content calendar), ensuring it is ready to be implemented.
